# 3D Prints

Thinkiverse/CAD designs(`.stl`), Ultimaker Cura slicer (`.3mf`), and other files for my 3D print projects.

## Reason

I need to track 3D printer design files better than just leaving the "good" `.gcode` file on a flash drive. I've had multiple occasions where I need to reprint something years later and all I have is the `.gcode` file.
