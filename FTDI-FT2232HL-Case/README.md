# FT2232HL Case

Case for my FT2232HL FTDI ESP32 debugger.

## STL Files

`ft232-bot.stl` and `ft2232-top.stl` are the original files downloaded from Thingiverse. I can't find the originals on the site anymore.

The port for pins on the `top` part didn't work for my board because I already had header pins in every slot. I took that file and created `FT2232HL_Top_Remix` in `Fusion 360`. 

## Slicer Project
`ft2232-case-2.3mf` is the `Ultimaker Cura 4.13` project file used to generate the `.gcode` I use on my 3D printer.
